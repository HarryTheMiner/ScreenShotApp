ðŸ“¸ Tkinter Screenshot Capture Tool<br>
This Python script creates a simple GUI-based Screenshot Tool using Tkinter and PyAutoGUI. The application provides a button to capture a screenshot after a 5-second delay and save it with a timestamped filename in the specified directory. The GUI consists of two buttons:<br>

"Take Screen-Shot" â€“ Captures and displays the screenshot.<br>

"Quit" â€“ Closes the application.<br>

The script ensures that the Tcl/Tk library path is correctly set for smooth execution. It can be useful for quick screen captures without manually saving images. ðŸš€<br>
